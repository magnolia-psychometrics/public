# Supplemental Research Preview Disclaimer & Analytics Consent
_Last updated: November, 24th, 2025_

This Supplemental Research Preview Disclaimer & Analytics Consent (“**Supplemental Disclaimer**”) applies to the software applications, demos, and interactive research previews (each an “**App**”) published or made available by **magnolia psychometrics GmbH** (“**Company**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” “**our**”) on Hugging Face or any other hosting platform.

This Supplemental Disclaimer is **in addition to** (and forms part of) our main Terms of Service, Imprint/Legal Notice, and Privacy Policy (collectively, the “**Main Terms**”). If there is a conflict, this Supplemental Disclaimer controls **only for the Apps**. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meanings in the Main Terms.

## 1. Acceptance of This Supplemental Disclaimer
By clicking “I agree” (or equivalent), accessing, or using any App, you confirm that you:
1. have read and understood this Supplemental Disclaimer,
2. agree to be bound by it, and  
3. are legally able to enter into it on your own behalf or on behalf of an entity you represent.

If you do not agree, **do not access or use the App**.

---

## 2. Research Preview / Experimental Nature
The Apps are provided as **experimental, research, preview, alpha/beta, or demonstration software**. They may be incomplete, change without notice, contain errors, and produce inaccurate or unexpected results. We do not promise that any App will remain available, supported, updated, or compatible with future systems.

---

## 3. No Reliance; No Professional Advice
Apps and any outputs, predictions, recommendations, or generated content (“**Outputs**”) are for **informational and research purposes only**. They do **not** constitute professional, medical, legal, financial, safety, or other advice.

You acknowledge and agree that:
- Outputs may be incorrect, incomplete, biased, offensive, or unsuitable for your purposes.
- You will **independently verify** any Output before relying on it.
- You will not use an App or Output for high-stakes decisions (e.g., medical diagnosis, legal compliance, financial trading, critical infrastructure, emergency response) without appropriate expert review.

You remain solely responsible for how you use the Apps and Outputs.

---

## 4. Your Responsibilities
You agree that you will:
- use the Apps only in compliance with applicable laws and regulations;
- not upload or submit anything unlawful, infringing, harmful, or that you do not have the right to use;
- not attempt to reverse engineer, disrupt, overload, probe, or bypass security or usage limits;
- not use the Apps to develop, train, or deploy systems that violate third-party rights or laws; and
- **not submit sensitive personal data** (e.g., health, biometric, government IDs), confidential information, or trade secrets.

---

## 5. “AS IS” / No Warranty
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Apps and Outputs are provided **“AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE,”** without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise. This includes (without limitation) any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, accuracy, availability, or that the App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.

---

## 6. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law:

1. **No indirect damages.** We will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, business interruption, or computer/system failure arising out of or related to any App, Output, or this Supplemental Disclaimer—whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other legal theory—even if we were advised of the possibility of such damages.

2. **Liability cap.** Our total aggregate liability for any claim related to an App or this Supplemental Disclaimer will not exceed the greater of:
   - **EUR 50**, or
   - the amount you paid (if any) to access the App in the **12 months** before the event giving rise to the claim.

3. **Mandatory carve-outs.** Nothing in this Supplemental Disclaimer limits liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law (for example, liability for intent, gross negligence, fraud, or death/personal injury where such exclusions are prohibited).

You acknowledge that these limitations are a fundamental basis of our providing the Apps.

## 7. Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Company, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, contractors, and agents from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from or relating to:
- your access to or use of an App or Outputs,
- your violation of this Supplemental Disclaimer, the Main Terms, or applicable law,
- your content, inputs, or data you submit to an App, or
- your infringement or alleged infringement of any third-party right.

## 8. Third-Party Platforms, Models, and Services
The Apps may be hosted on or depend on third-party services (e.g., Hugging Face Spaces, model providers, APIs, or cloud infrastructure). Third parties may have their own terms and privacy practices. We do not control and are not responsible for third-party services or their availability, security, or content. Your use of those services is at your own risk and subject to their terms.{index=8}

## 9. Analytics, Usage Data & Tracking Consent
### 9.1 What we collect
By using an App, you consent to our collection of **usage and technical analytics** to improve reliability, safety, and research quality. This may include:
- interaction events (e.g., button clicks, feature usage, error events),
- performance and diagnostic logs,
- approximate location derived from IP (country/region level),
- device and browser/app metadata (e.g., OS, version, screen size),
- timestamps, session identifiers, and referral/UTM data.

### 9.2 What we do **not** intentionally collect
We do **not** intentionally collect directly identifying information such as your name, email address, exact location, or government identifiers through these Apps, unless you explicitly provide it in an input field.  
**Do not enter personal or sensitive information** into an App. If you do, you do so at your own risk.

### 9.3 Purpose and legal basis
We process analytics data to:
- operate and secure the Apps,
- measure usage and performance,
- debug and improve models/features, and
- produce aggregated research insights.

The legal basis is your **consent** (via this checkbox) and our legitimate interest in operating and improving the Apps, where applicable.

### 9.4 Sharing and processing
Analytics data may be processed by:
- our internal systems, and/or
- vetted service providers acting on our behalf (e.g., logging, monitoring, or analytics tools).

We require such providers to protect the data and use it only for our instructions.

### 9.5 Retention
We retain analytics data only as long as necessary for the purposes above, after which it is deleted or anonymized.

### 9.6 Withdrawal
You may withdraw consent by ceasing to use the Apps. Where technically feasible, we may also provide opt-out controls inside the App.

## 10. Security & Data Integrity
We use reasonable measures to protect the Apps, but **no system is perfectly secure**. You accept the risk that data transmission over the internet may not be fully secure and that Outputs or stored logs could be lost, corrupted, or accessed unlawfully.

---

## 11. Feedback License
If you provide feedback, suggestions, or ideas regarding an App, you grant us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, modify, and incorporate that feedback into our products and research without compensation or attribution.

---

## 12. Suspension, Termination, and Changes
We may suspend or terminate your access to any App at any time, with or without notice, including if we believe you violated this Supplemental Disclaimer or the Main Terms.

We may update this Supplemental Disclaimer from time to time. Changes apply when posted. Continued use of an App after an update means you accept the updated terms.

---

## 13. Governing Law & Venue
Unless otherwise specified in the Main Terms, this Supplemental Disclaimer is governed by the laws of the German Federation, excluding conflict-of-law rules.
